# Submission project for CrowdSourceHire

This is a simple VS2013 project, using C++11.  I could have written under Linux, but I have issues with my Ubuntu partition at the moment.  The only difference would have been the Makefile.

## Sample output

2/3 -4/2
2/3 + (-2 ) = (-1 1/3)
2/3 - (-2 ) = 2 2/3
2/3 * (-2 ) = (-1 1/3)
2/3 / (-2 ) = (-1/3)
5/3 0/6
1 2/3 + 0/6 = 1 2/3
1 2/3 - 0/6 = 1 2/3
1 2/3 * 0/6 = 0/18
1 2/3 / 0/6 = Inf
1/4 31/6
1/4 + 5 1/6 = 5 5/12
1/4 - 5 1/6 = (-4 11/12)
1/4 * 5 1/6 = 1 7/24
1/4 / 5 1/6 = 3/62
2/8 7/14
1/4 + 1/2 = 3/4
1/4 - 1/2 = (-1/4)
1/4 * 1/2 = 1/8
1/4 / 1/2 = 1/2
